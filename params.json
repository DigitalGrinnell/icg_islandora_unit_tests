  "body": "# ICG Islandora Unit Tests\r\n\r\n#### AUTHORS\r\n* David Keiser-Clark (dwk2@williams.edu), Office for Information Technology, Williams College\r\n* (Chris Warren, formerly of Williams College)\r\n\r\n## INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThis is a set of unit tests, based on the [Simpletest](http://simpletest.org/index.html) framework, for verifying functionality of an Islandora site or multiple sites.\r\nInstructions for use:\r\n\r\n1. Copy the \"institution.cfg.php.sample\" file and rename it \"institution.cfg.php\"\r\n1. Update the default values within the \"institution.cfg.php\" configuration file\r\n1. From your laptop, navigate to the correct localhost path (i.e. http://localhost/icg_islandora_unit_tests/TestNarrowSuite.php) to run this set of unit test files against any live or local server. \r\n1. Note that testing against \"TestNarrowSuite.php\" offers micro-control for developing tests, while \"TestOfWebPageSuite.php\" or \"TestOfAllSuite.php\" runs against larger or all available tests.  \r\n\r\n#### FEATURES\r\n* Single configuration file (institution.cfg.php) permits you to set the target domain. It is easy to switch tests between local, development or production servers.\r\n* Test the live, dev or local server (and easily switch your focus)\r\n* Test web accessibility\r\n* Test database (Fedora) accessibility\r\n* Test main site and multisite accessibility \r\n* Test basic site functionality\r\n* Test existence of specific pages\r\n* Test solution packs\r\n* Test collections (this site only)\r\n* Test collection objects\r\n* Test search and facets\r\n* Test security conditions\r\n* Test login functionality and expectations\r\n* Test both HTTP and HTTPS functionality\r\n\r\n#### DEPENDENCIES\r\n* install: Apache, PHP 5.2 (or higher); can run locally by installing [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) (Apache/PHP development environment)\r\n* Note the following custom/edited files in the otherwise default \"/simpletest/\" directory:\r\n  1. \"web_tester_islandora.php\" (new file - extends default testing behavior)\r\n  1. \"reporter.php\" (edited file - improved css/html for more pleasant UI test results)\r\n\r\n#### LICENSE\r\n* Copyright (c) 2016 Williams College\r\n* Dual licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses.\r\n* Free as in Bacon.\r\n",
